# DFRoot [DirtyFrag (CVE-2026-43284)]

The core of this code is fully credited to others. I merely combined ideas to make them all better 
and added some small improvements/features.

- Selinux Permissive kernel modules and various code: https://github.com/polygraphene/DFReroot
- Unprivileged XFRM socket method: https://github.com/combeng6th/DirtyInit

## Features

- Start on Boot
- Automatic soft reboot 
- RO Partition Protection
- Hide Selinux Modifications in KSU
- Shizuku not needed — regain root without WiFi!

## How it works

The Android kernel decrypts AES-CBC ESP packets directly into the page cache of files open for `splice()`. By crafting `IV = AES_ECB_DEC(key, current_content) ⊕ desired_content`, any 16-byte-aligned block in a mapped shared library can be overwritten without write permission and without copy-on-write.

The exploit uses this primitive to patch shellcode into `libc++.so` and `libc.so` in the kernel's page cache. The next privileged call to those functions runs the shellcode and installs KernelSU.

### Exploit chain

1. **IpSec transform** — App allocates a `UdpEncapsulationSocket` + SPI and builds an AES-CBC/HMAC-SHA256 ESP transform via `IpSecManager`.

2. **splicehelper → crash_dump64** — helper binary spliced into `/apex/com.android.runtime/bin/crash_dump64` via the CBC primitive. `crash_dump64` can be called by unprivileged app with `type_transform` and gives read access to vendor library pages and splices them into a pipe so the parent can compute correct IVs. 

3. **dirtyfrag.ko → libstagefrighthw.so** — The kernel module is written into `/vendor/lib64/libstagefrighthw.so` with `vendor_file` label that can be modprobe'd

4. **libc++ hook** (runs in init, uid=0, tid=1) — entrypoint via createorphanprocess. patched with shellcode that forks, sets the child's SELinux exec context to `u:r:vendor_modprobe:s0`, and execs `/vendor/bin/modprobe`.

5. **libc hook** (runs in vendor_modprobe, uid=0) — Shellcode patched into `__libc_init`. When vendor_modprobe starts:
   - Calls `finit_module` to load dirtyfrag.ko
   - Opens ksud from the app's memfd via `/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>`, copies to `/dev/.ksud` and `/data/system/ksud`
   - Unshares mount namespace, bind-mounts `/dev/.ksud` over `/system/bin/logcat` (DEFEX bypass via trusted path)
   - Forks and execs ksud through the bind-mounted path

6. **KernelSU daemon launched** — libc/libc++ patches are restored and crash_dump64 is fadvised out of cache.

## Usage

Install the KernelSU Manager https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/releases/tag/v3.3.0

```sh
./create-keystore.sh
./build.sh
adb install -r dirtyfrag.apk
```
